A Python script that models a simple Carnot Battery (HP & ORC) and performs an advanced exergetic analysis. 

This is part of my Master Thesis at Technische Universit√§t Berlin ([Department of Energy Engineering and Environmental Protection](https://www.tu.berlin/en/energietechnik)).

## Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install Python (I'm currently using 3.8.16).

2. Create an environment using the [environment YAML file](https://github.com/sertomas/adex-carnot-battery/blob/main/adex_carnot_battery.yaml).

3. Clone this repository

## Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Run `cb_main` to create the model of the Carnot battery.
   
    *If you want to change the parameters of the HP or the ORC, you can do it in `cb_set_pars`.*

    *If you want to change the structure of the systems, you can do it in `cb_network`.*

1. Run `adv_exan` to perform an advanced exergetic analysis of the Carnot battery.
